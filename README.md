# Thailand Board Game Show 2021 Puzzles

This is a webapp for puzzles in Thailand Board Game Show 2021. It's created by me, a Code Breaker admin.

Players navigate in gather.town to find clues and use them to solve puzzles. Due to limitation, the puzzles need to be designed so that mobile user can also play. In doing so, the only interaction allowed in gather.town is a prompt message or a prompt image.
